# Foundation Method

Nowadays, web development is one of the most in-demand branches of programming. As a result, there are many resources available on the internet, to the point of becoming overwhelming, especially for new developers. Additionally, the sheer number of technologies (Frameworks and Libraries) can be daunting; trying to learn them all might lead to not learning anything at all.

In this repository, my goal is to document the way I learn the basics of full-stack development, using React, Node, Express, and MongoDB, by creating a small app that simulates the most basic functions of any application.

As I mentioned earlier, the objective is to lay the foundations, so this is not a method to become a super developer. The only way to become a great developer is to practice, practice, and never stop learning.

### What does the app consist of?

The application to be created will be the classic Tic Tac Toe game. In summary, the interface will be built using React, which will make requests to a server to retrieve, update, and store the game data. One might think that this adds too much complexity for such a simple app, but it's ideal for diving into these technologies without burning out on the app's logic, allowing you to focus adequately on the technologies to be learned.

### What should you know?

The three most basic pillars of web development:
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
